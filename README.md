## Project Goals

The objective of this project was to create a website application that provides a positive user experience while allowing users to share their recipes and interract with other users. The website includes the following features:

- Basic authentication and authorization functionality.
- Intuitive navigation system for positive UX.
- Full CRUD functionality that enables users to share their own recipes, read other users recipes, and update or delete their own recipes, comments, likes, and follow functionality.
- Filter options that allow users to sort through recipes by the ones that they have liked and recipes posted by followed users. Filter options to search for specific titles, authors or ingredients is also available.
- Capability to modify profile information such as bio text and images.


## User Experience (UX)

**User Stories**: 

User stories are being tracked using GitHub Projects. All User Stories have been divided into Acceptance Criteria and Tasks. 

### Wireframes
When designing the layout of the website I created Wireframes for the landing page and home page:



## Features

### Navigation bar
  - The navigation bar features a Logo the left, that acts as a link to the home page. The navigation bar has a consistent placement on each page making the website easy to navigate. The navigation bar is responsive, logo size, text and icons adapts to different screen sizes.
The navigation bar features links to the Home, Sign in and Sign up pages. If the user is logged in however, the navigation bar will include links to the following pages: Add recipe, Home, Feed, Liked, Followed and Profile.

## The Search bar

## The Home Page
The Home Page displays the posted recipes by all users, sorted by most recently created post first. The Home Page uses a infinite scroll functionality in order to provide users with the ability to seemlessly scroll through recipes without having to press "Next Page" etc.
The owners name, date of creation or when it was last updated, as well as all content of an individual recipe is visible to the user when scrolling through the Home Page content, except for posted comments and rating.

## The Popular Profiles Component
The Popular Profiles Component is visible on the Home, Feed, Liked and Profile pages. It displays the most followed profiles to the right of the content on the page on desktop, and in the center below the navigation bar on mobile devices. 

## The Recipe Page
The Recipe Page is the page displaying an individual recipe, including all content of the recipe as well as any likes and comments. When viewing an individual recipe that you are the owner of, the possibility to update or delete the recipe is available in the form of a dropdown menu to the right of the creation date.
A comment is displayed with the comments owner's username, avatar, date of comments creation or when it was last updated, and the rating, users can create, read, update and delete any comment providing full CRUD functionality.

- I have created the website using the principles of UX and made sure that it functions the way it should on all standard devices using the devtools device toolbar.
- I have confirmed that all components are legible in terms of positioning and readability, and work as intended.
- No elements are distracted by background-colors, and no images are stretched when viewed on different devices.
- I have made sure that all functionality work properly and the website works as intended.
- I have made sure that all buttons functionality is working.
